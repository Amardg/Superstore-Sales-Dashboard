# Comprehensive Superstore Sales and Forecasting Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of the Superstore Sales dataset using Power BI, with a dual focus: historical performance tracking and short-term sales forecasting.

The dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making by segmenting sales and profit across critical business dimensions and offering a 15-day sales prediction.

## Key Analyses Included
The dashboard covers the following dimensions of analysis, based on Sales and Profit:
* **Geographic:** Sales by Region.

* **Product Hierarchy:** Sales by Category and Sub-Category.
* **Logistics:** Sales by Ship Mode.
* **Time Series:** Sales by Month, Profit by Month, and a combined Sales & Profit view.

### Key Insights & Findings:
Finding 1,: The West Region is a dominant revenue driver, but the Central Region consistently struggles with low Profit Ratio across all ship modes.
Finding 2, : Despite high sales in the 'Technology' category, 'Office Supplies' often yields better month-over-month profit consistency.
Finding 3 : The 15-day forecast indicates a slight upward sales trend for the next two weeks, with the 95% confidence interval showing a potential peak around day 10.
